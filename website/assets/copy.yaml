  Lockie protects your passwords without saving any secret 
  used to encrypt and decrypt your data. It gives you the freedom 
  of storing your own secret keys on your local device while 
  securing your information on a cloud service. 

  As an open-source project, anyone can contribute and not only that. 
  You can also follow a simple tutorial provided to you to compile, 
  build and run your own Lockie app on your own servers.
